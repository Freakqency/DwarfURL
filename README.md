A highly scalable URL Shortener system that can generate up to 3.5 trillion unique URLs, can handle a load of up to 30
million calls/month, and uses base62 encoding to generate unique 7-byte short URLs. Implemented Redis caching system for faster retrieval
of the URLs. Utilized a hash map for mapping long URLs to short URLs. Deployed the entire application at [online](https://dwarfurl.onrender.com/)
